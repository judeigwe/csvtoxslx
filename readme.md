In this setup, the workflow does the following:

Checks out the repository.
Sets up Python.
Installs the required Python dependencies (pandas and openpyxl).
Creates the CSV file and writes sample data to it.
Executes a Python script inline to read the CSV file and convert it to XLSX format.
You can customize the sample CSV data and adjust the script to fit your requirements. Save this content in your .github/workflows/convert_csv_to_xlsx.yml file, and push it to your repository to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
